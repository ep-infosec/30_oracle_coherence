== Custom Aggregators

This guide walks you through how to create custom aggregators that allow you to process data stored in Coherence in parallel.

Coherence supports entry aggregators that perform operations against all, or a subset
of entries to obtain a single result. This aggregation is carried out in parallel across the cluster
and is a map-reduce type of operation which can be performed efficiently across large amounts of data.

See the {commercial-docs-base-url}/develop-applications/processing-data-cache.html#GUID-DFB7AB0C-1CE6-4259-8854-9DA1F40B6F15[Coherence Documentation]
for detailed information on Aggregations.

[#what-you-will-build]
=== What You Will Build

This example shows how to build a custom aggregator which we will
use to count how many times a particular word occurs in documents stored in Coherence maps. The `Document`
class is a standard POJO with an identifier, and a string for the document contents.

[#running]
==== Running the Examples

This example can be run directly in your IDE, but to best demonstrate the functionality
you should run 1 or more cache servers and then run the example class.

1. Running Cache Servers
+
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw exec:exec -P server
----
+
or
+
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew runServer -x test
----

2. Running each example
+
Each example can be run direct from the IDE, or can be run via executing the tests.
+
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean verify
----
+
or
+
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew clean test
----

[#data-model]
=== Example Data Model

The data model consists of the `Document` class which represents a document with text contents that we
are going to search.

[#example-code-2]
==== Review the Example Code

The `WordCount` class implements the `InvocableMap.StreamingAggregator` as well as `Serializable` for serialization.

When you implement `InvocableMap.StreamingAggregator`, you must implement the following methods:

* `supply()` - creates an instance we can accumulate into in parallel
* `accumulate()` - adds single entry to partial result when executing on storage members
* `getPartialResult()` - returns the partial result
* `combine()` - combines partial results on the client
* `finalizeResult()` - applies finishing transformation to the final result and returns it

See below for details of each of the `WordCount` class.

1. Implementing interfaces
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/aggregations/WordCount.java[tag=class]
----
+
<1> Implement the `InvocableMap.StreamingAggregator` with key, value, partial result and final result
<2> Implement serialization

2. The following constructor is used to set the words to search for.
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/aggregations/WordCount.java[tag=constructor]
----

3. Creates an instance we can accumulate into in parallel when executing on the storage members
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/aggregations/WordCount.java[tag=supply]
----

4. Adds single entry to partial result when executing on storage members
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/aggregations/WordCount.java[tag=accumulate]
----
+
<1> Count the number of times the word occurs in the document
<2> Add or update the count for the word in the results Map

5. Return the partial result
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/aggregations/WordCount.java[tag=getPartialResult]
----

6. Combine all the partial results on the client
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/aggregations/WordCount.java[tag=combine]
----
+
NOTE: This method is called on the client to combine the results passed in with the current result. This is
used to get the final set of results from all members.

7. Take the final partial result and applies any finishing transformation
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/aggregations/WordCount.java[tag=finalizeResult]
----

8. Characteristics for the aggregator
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/aggregations/WordCount.java[tag=characteristics]
----
+
NOTE: We specifically set the PARALLEL and PRESENT_ONLY characteristics to indicate this can be run in parallel and
to execute to only run on entries that are present.

*CustomAggregationExample Class*

The `runExample()` method contains the code that exercises the above custom aggregator.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/aggregations/CustomAggregationExample.java[tag=runExample]
----

<1> Run the aggregator against 5 randomly chosen words

[#run-example-2]
==== Run the Example

Carry out the following to run this example:

1. Start 2 cache servers using the method described above:
+
E.g. for Maven use:
+
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw exec:exec -P server
----
+
or
+
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew runServer -x test
----

2. Running the example
+
The example can be run direct from the IDE by directly running the `CustomAggregationExample` class
, or can be run via executing the tests.
+
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean verify
----
+
or
+
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew clean test
----

+
This will generate output similar to the following indicating the documents and times that a
word exists in a document.
+
[source,bash]
----
Documents added 2000
Running against the following words: [fifteen, tv, trumpet, this, launch]
<Info> (thread=PartitionedCacheWorker:0x0000:2, member=2): ***** getPartialResult: {fifteen=181, tv=350, trumpet=194, this=1155, launch=189}
<Info> (thread=main, member=2): ***** combine: Received partial result {fifteen=177, tv=376, trumpet=210, this=1173, launch=193}
<Info> (thread=main, member=2): ***** combine: Received partial result {fifteen=181, tv=350, trumpet=194, this=1155, launch=189}
Word fifteen, number of occurrences: 358
Word tv, number of occurrences: 726
Word trumpet, number of occurrences: 404
Word this, number of occurrences: 2328
Word launch, number of occurrences: 382
----
+
NOTE: The messages above containing `combine` are when the client called the `combine()` method to
aggregate the final results returned from the storage members. In this case we had 2 storage members including
the test itself.

[#summary]
=== Summary

times a word appears in documents stored in Coherence.
