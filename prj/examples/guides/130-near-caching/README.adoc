== Near Caching

This guide walks you through how to use near caching within Coherence by providing
various examples and configurations that showcase the different features available.

A near cache is a hybrid cache; it typically fronts a distributed cache or a remote cache
with a local cache. Near cache invalidates front cache entries, using a configured
invalidation strategy, and provides excellent performance and synchronization.
Near cache backed by a partitioned cache offers zero-millisecond local access for
repeat data access, while enabling concurrency and ensuring coherency and fail over,
effectively combining the best attributes of replicated and partitioned caches.

See the {commercial-docs-base-url}/develop-applications/introduction-coherence-caches.html[Coherence Documentation]
for detailed information on near caches.

=== What You Will Build

In this example you will run a number of tests and that show the following features of near caches:

* Configuring near caches
* Setting near cache size limits

[#example-code-1]
=== Review the Example Code

The example code comprises the `SimpleNearCachingExample` class, which uses the `near-cache-config.xml`
configuration to define a near cache. The front cache is configured with 100 entries as the `high-units`
and the back cache is a distributed cache.

When a near cache has reached it's `high-units` limit, it prunes itself back to the
value of the `low-units` element (or not less than 80% of `high-units` if not set).  The entries
chosen are done so according to the configured `eviction-policy`.

There are a number of eviction policies that can be used including: Least Recently Used (LRU),
Least Frequently Used (LFU), Hybrid or custom.

The test class carries out the following steps:

* Inserts 100 entries into the cache
* Issues a get on each of the 100 entries and displays the time taken (populates the near cache's front cache)
* Displays `CacheMBean` metrics for the front cache
* Carries out a second get on the 100 entries and notes the difference in the time to retrieve the entries
* Inserts an additional 10 entries then issue gets for those entries, which will cause cache pruning
* Displays `CacheMBean` metrics for the front cache to show cache pruning happening
* Displays `StorageManagerMBean` metrics to show listener registrations
//-

There are two tests that exercise the above `SimpleNearCachingExample` class and using different caches
as well as different invalidation strategies set via a system property. They are described in more detail in the following sections.

* com.oracle.coherence.guides.nearcaching.SimpleNearCachingExamplePRESENTTest

[#example-tests-1]
=== Review the Tests

The main `SimpleNearCachingExample` class is exercised by running the following tests :

* SimpleNearCachingExampleALLTest - uses `all` invalidation strategy and high units of 100
* SimpleNearCachingExamplePRESENTTest - uses `present` invalidation strategy and high units of 100

//-
There are a number of invalidation strategies, described {commercial-docs-base-url}/develop-applications/configuring-caches.html#GUID-78557F0D-1CCC-4A4B-B52C-61D6EBF88295[here],
but we will utilize the following for the tests above:

* `all` - This strategy instructs a near cache to listen to all back cache events. This strategy is optimal for read-heavy tiered access patterns where there is significant overlap between the different instances of front caches.
* `present` - This strategy instructs a near cache to listen to the back cache events related only to the items currently present in the front cache. This strategy works best when each instance of a front cache contains distinct subset of data relative to the other front cache instances (for example, sticky data access patterns).

NOTE: The default strategy is `auto`, which is identical to the `present` strategy.

1. Review the `SimpleNearCachingExampleALLTest`
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/nearcaching/SimpleNearCachingExampleALLTest.java[tag=test]
----
+
NOTE: This test runs with a cache called `size-cache-all`, which matches the size limited near cache and
invalidation strategy of `all`.

2. Review the `SimpleNearCachingExamplePRESENTTest`
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/nearcaching/SimpleNearCachingExamplePRESENTTest.java[tag=test]
----
+
NOTE: This test runs with a cache called `size-cache-present`, which matches the size limited near cache and
invalidation strategy of `present.

*SimpleNearCachingExamplePRESENTTest Output*

The output is similar to the above output, but you will notice that the number of listeners registered are higher as we are using the `Present` strategy
that will register a listener for each entry in the front of the near cache.
