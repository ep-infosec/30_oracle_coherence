== Streams

This guide walks you through how to use the Streams API with Coherence.

The Java streams implementation provides an efficient way to query and process data
sequentially or in parallel to take advantage of multi-core architectures.

The processing occurs in steps:

1. Data is aggregated from a source (such as collections or arrays) into a read-only stream.
   The stream represents object references and does not actually store the data.

2. Intermediate operations are then declared on the stream. Intermediate operations for filtering,
   sorting, mapping, and so on are supported. Lambda expressions are often used when declaring
   intermediate operations and provide a functional way to work on the data.
   Intermediate operations are aggregated and can be chained together: each subsequent operation
   is performed on a stream that contains the result of the previous operation. Intermediate operations are lazy and are not actually executed until a final terminal operation is performed.

3. A final terminal operation is declared. Terminal operations for counting, adding, averaging,
   and so on are supported. The terminal operation automatically iterates over the objects in the
   stream returns an aggregated result.

Java streams provide similar functionality as Coherence data grid aggregation.
However, streams are not efficient when executed in a distributed environment.
To leverage the stream programming model and also ensure that streams can be executed remotely
across the cluster, Coherence has extended the streams API.

[#what-you-will-build]
=== What You Will Build

In this example you will utilize streams methods on the `NamedMap` API to query and aggregate
and group data from a contacts `NamedMap`.

[#running]
==== Running the Examples

This example can be run direct from the IDE, or can be run via executing the tests.

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean verify
----

or

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew clean test
----

[#data-model]
=== Example Data Model

The data model consists of the following classes in two maps, `customers` and `orders`

* `Contact` - Represents a contact
* `Address` - Represents an address for a contact

==== Contact

Contacts have various attributes as described below including home and work addresses stored in the `Address` class.

include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/streams/Contact.java[tag=class]
----

==== Address

Address contains address details for a `Contact`.
