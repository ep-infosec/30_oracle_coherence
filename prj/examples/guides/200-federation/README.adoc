== Federation

This guide walks through the steps to use Coherence Federation by using Coherence Query Language (CohQL)
to insert, update and remove data in Federated clusters.

Federated caching federates cache data asynchronously across multiple geographically dispersed clusters.
Cached data is federated across clusters to provide redundancy, off-site backup, and multiple points
of access for application users in different geographical locations.

Federated caching supports multiple federation topologies. These include: active-active, active-passive, hub-spoke,
and central-federation. The topologies define common federation strategies between clusters and support a wide variety of use cases.
Custom federation topologies can also be created as required.

Federated caching provides applications with the ability to accept, reject, or modify cache entries being stored
locally or remotely. Conflict resolution is application specific
to allow the greatest amount of flexibility when defining federation rules.

NOTE: Federation is only available when using Coherence Grid Edition (GE) 12.2.1.4.X and above, and is not available in the open-source
Coherence Community Edition (CE).

NOTE: As Coherence Grid Edition JAR's and not available in Maven central, to build and run
this example you, must first install the Coherence JAR into your Maven Repository from your
local Grid Edition Install. See <<building,here>> for instructions on how to complete this.

[#what-you-will-build]
=== What You Will Build

You will review the operational and cache configuration required to set up Federated Coherence clusters and carry out the following:

1. Start one or more cache servers for `PrimaryCluster`
2. Start one or more cache servers for `SecondaryCluster`
3. Start a `CohQL` session for `PrimaryCluster`
4. Start a `CohQL` session for `SecondaryCluster`
5. Carry out various data operations on each cluster and observe the data being replicated

The default configuration for this example runs the following clusters:

1. `PrimaryCluster` on 127.0.0.1:7574
2. `SecondaryCluster` on 127.0.0.1:7575

You can change these hosts/ports by changing the following in the `pom.xml`:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::pom.xml[tag=ports]
----

NOTE: If you wish to know more about Coherence Federation, please see the
{commercial-docs-base-url}/administer/federating-caches-clusters.html[Coherence Documentation].

[#building]
==== Building the Example Code

**Important**

Because Coherence Federation is only available in Grid Edition, you must carry out the following changes to the project before building and running:

1. Update the `coherence.version` property in your `pom.xml` and `gradle.properties` to the Coherence Grid Edition version you are going to use.
2. Change the `coherence.group.id` in the above files to `com.oracle.coherence`.
3. Install Coherence Grid Edition into your local Maven repository by running the following:
+
This example assumes you have Coherence 14.1.1. Please adjust for your Coherence version.
+
[source,bas,indent=0]
----
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=$COHERENCE_HOME/lib/coherence.jar \
    -DpomFile=$COHERENCE_HOME/plugins/maven/com/oracle/coherence/coherence/14.1.1/coherence.14.1.1.pom

=== Review the Project

[#maven]
==== Maven Configuration

The initial project is a Coherence project and imports the `coherence-bom` and `coherence-dependencies`
POMs as shown below:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::pom.xml[tag=deps1]
----

The `coherence` library is also included:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::pom.xml[tag=deps2]
----

We also define a number of profiles to run the `DefaultCacheServer` for each cluster and `CohQL` for each cluster.

* <<primary-storage,primary-storage - Runs a DefaultCacheServer for the PrimaryCluster>>
* <<primary-cohql,primary-cohql - Runs a CohQL session for the PrimaryCluster>>
* <<secondary-storage,secondary-storage - Runs a DefaultCacheServer for the SecondaryCluster>>
* <<secondary-cohql,secondary-cohql - Runs a CohQL session for the SecondaryCluster>>

[#primary-storage]
*primary-storage* - Runs a `DefaultCacheServer` for the `PrimaryCluster`

[#cache-config]
==== Federation Configuration

Federated caching is configured using Coherence configuration files and requires no changes to application code.

There are two areas that require configuration for Federation:

1. An operational override file is used to configure federation participants and the federation topology.
2. A cache configuration file is used to create federated caches schemes.

NOTE: A federated cache is a type of partitioned cache service and is managed by a federated cache service instance.

1. The following cache configuration file is used to define the Federated service:
+
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/resources/federation-cache-config.xml[tag=mapping]
----
+
<1> A cache-mapping for all caches (*) to map to a scheme called `federated`
<2> The federated-scheme in a similar way to a distributed-scheme
<3> A topology for the federated-scheme. The default topology is `active-active` so this element is not required and just included for completeness.


2.  The following operational configuration file is used to define the participants and topology:
+
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/resources/tangosol-coherence-override.xml[tag=mapping]
----
+
<1> `PrimaryCluster` participant with its host and port for the cluster Name Service
<2> `SecondaryCluster` participant with its host and port for the cluster Name Service
<3> Topology that defines an `active-active` configuration between clusters. This is the default and not strictly required.


[#run-the-example]
=== Run the Example

After you have built the project as described earlier in this document you can run via Maven or Gradle.

==== Maven

1. Start a DefaultCache server for the primary and secondary clusters in separate terminals.
+
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw exec:exec -P primary-storage
----
+
and
+
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw exec:exec -P secondary-storage
----

2. Start a CohQL session for the primary and secondary clusters in separate terminals.
+
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw exec:java -P primary-cohql
----
+
and
+
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw exec:java -P secondary-cohql
----

==== Gradle

1. Start a DefaultCache server for the primary and secondary clusters in separate terminals.
+
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew runServerPrimary
----
+
and
+
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew runServerSecondary
----

2. Start a CohQL session for the primary and secondary clusters in separate terminals.
+
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew runCohQLPrimary --console=plain
----
+
and
+
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew runCohQLSecondary --console=plain
----

==== Run the following commands to exercise Federation

1. In each of the `CohQL` sessions, run the following command to verify the caches are empty in each cluster:
+
[source,bash]
----
CohQL> select count() from test
Results
0
----

2. In the first (PrimaryCluster) `CohQL` session, add an entry to the cache `test`:
+
[source,bash]
----
CohQL> insert into test key(1) value("Tim")

CohQL> select key(), value() from test
Results
[1, "Tim"]
----

3. In the second (SecondaryCluster) `CohQL` session, verify the entry was sent from the PrimaryCluster and
then update the name to `Timothy`. As the clusters are `active-active`, the changes will be sent back to the primary cluster.
+
[source,bash]
----
CohQL> select key(), value() from test
Results
[1, "Tim"]

CohQL> update 'test' set value() = "Timothy"
Results
1: true

CohQL> select key(), value() from test
Results
[1, "Timothy"]
----

4. In the first (PrimaryCluster) `CohQL` session, verify the entry was changed via the change in the `SecondaryCluster`, then delete the entry and confirm it was deleted in the `SecondaryCluster`
+
[source,bash]
----
CohQL> select key(), value() from test
Results
[1, "Timothy"]

CohQL> update 'test' set value() = "Timothy"
Results
1: true

CohQL> select key(), value() from test
Results
[1, "Timothy"]

CohQL> delete from test
Results

CohQL> select key(), value() from test
Results
----

5. Continue experimenting:
+
You can continue to experiment by inserting, updating or removing data using various `CohQL` commands.
+
For detailed information on how to use CohQL, please visit the chapter
link:{commercial-docs-base-url}/develop-applications/using-coherence-query-language.html#GUID-C0D082B1-FA62-4899-A043-4345156E6641[Using Coherence Query Language]
in the Coherence reference guide.

6. Monitor Federation
+
If you want to monitor Federation, you can do this via the Coherence VisualVM Plugin.
See https://github.com/oracle/coherence-visualvm#install[here]
for how to install the Plugin if you have `VisualVM` already, otherwise visit https://visualvm.github.io/[https://visualvm.github.io/] to download
and install `VisualVM`.
+
Once you have installed the plugin, you can click on one of the `DefaultCacheServer` process, and you will see the `Federation` tab as shown below:
