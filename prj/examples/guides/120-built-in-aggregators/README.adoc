== Built-In Aggregators

This guide walks you through how to use built-in aggregators such as including count, sum,
min, average and top which allow you to process data stored in Coherence in parallel.

Coherence supports entry aggregators that perform operations against all, or a subset
of entries to obtain a single result. This aggregation is carried out in parallel across the cluster
and is a map-reduce type of operation which can be performed efficiently across large amounts of data.

See the {commercial-docs-base-url}/develop-applications/processing-data-cache.html#GUID-DFB7AB0C-1CE6-4259-8854-9DA1F40B6F15[Coherence Documentation]
for detailed information on Aggregations.

[#what-you-will-build]
=== What You Will Build

In this example you will utilize the built-in aggregators such as `count`, `sum`,
`min`, `average` and `top` on orders and customers maps.

You will also use the `Aggregators` class and its helpers to simplify aggregator usage.

[#running]
==== Running the Examples

This example can be run directly in your IDE, but to best demonstrate the functionality
you should run 1 or more cache servers and then run the example class.

1. Running Cache Servers
+
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw exec:exec -P server
----
+
or
+
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew runServer -x test
----

2. Running each example
+
Each example can be run direct from the IDE, or can be run via executing the tests.
+
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean verify
----
+
or
+
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew clean test
----

[#data-model]
=== Example Data Model

The data model consists of the following classes in two maps, `customers` and `orders`

* `Customer` - Represents a customer
* `Order` - Represents and order for a customer and contains order lines
* `OrderLine` - Represents an individual order line for an order
* `Address` - Represents an address for a customer

[#example-code-1]
=== Review the Example Code

In this example we will show a number of the built-in aggregation functions in action. The full list is:

* count
* distinct
* average
* max
* min
* top
* sum

All the above aggregators can be implemented using static helpers in the `Aggregators` class, for example
`Aggregators.count()`. The helpers create the right aggregator type based on the type of method reference/extractor
that is passed as an argument. They all return the `EntryAggregator` implementations
 which allows them to be passed as argument to the aggregate methods below.

* `public default <R> R aggregate(EntryAggregator<? super K, ? super V, R> aggregator)` - Aggregate across all entries in a cache
* `public <R> R aggregate(Collection<? extends K> collKeys, EntryAggregator<? super K, ? super V, R> aggregator);` - Aggregate across a set of entries defined by the keys
* `public <R> R aggregate(Filter filter, EntryAggregator<? super K, ? super V, R> aggregator);` - Aggregate across a set of entries defines by the filter

The `SimpleAggregationExample` runs various aggregations using a number of the above functions.

1. Example Details
+
The `runExample()` method contains the code that exercises the above aggregators. Refer to the inline
code comments for explanations of what each aggregator is doing.

[#run-example-1]
=== Run the Example

Carry out the following to run this example:

1. Start 2 cache servers using the method described above:
+
E.g. for Maven use:
+
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw exec:exec -P server
----
+
or
+
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew runServer -x test
----

2. Run the following to load the data and run the example.
+
E.g. for Maven use:
+
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean verify
----
+
or
+
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew clean test
----
+
This will generate output similar to the following: (timestamps have been removed from output)
+
[source,bash]

=== Summary

You have seen how to use built-in aggregators which include `count`, `sum`,
`min`, `average` and `top` on orders and customers maps.

You also used the `Aggregators` class and its helpers to simplify aggregator usage.
