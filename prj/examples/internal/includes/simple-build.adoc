The source code for the guides and tutorials can be found in the
http://github.com/oracle/coherence/tree/master/prj/examples[Coherence CE GitHub repo]


The example source code is structured as both a Maven and a Gradle project and can be easily built with either
of those build tools. The examples are stand-alone projects so each example can be built from the
specific project directory without needing to build the whole Coherence project.

* Build with Maven

Using the included Maven wrapper the example can be built with the command:
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean package
----

* Build with Gradle

Using the included Gradle wrapper the example can be built with the command:
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew build
----
