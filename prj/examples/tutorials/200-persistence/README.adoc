== Persistence

This tutorial walks through Coherence Persistence by using Coherence Query Language (CohQL)
to create, recover and manage snapshots, monitor snapshot operations via JMX MBean notifications and
work with archived snapshots.

Coherence Persistence is a set of tools and technologies that manage the persistence and
recovery of Coherence distributed caches. Cached data is persisted so that it can be quickly recovered after
a catastrophic failure or after a cluster restart due to planned maintenance.

Persistence can operate in two modes:

* On-Demand persistence mode – a cache service is manually persisted and recovered upon request using the
persistence coordinator. The persistence coordinator is exposed as an MBean interface that provides
operations for creating, archiving, and recovering snapshots of a cache service.

* Active persistence mode – In this mode, cache contents are automatically persisted on all mutations and are
automatically recovered on cluster/service startup. The persistence coordinator can still
be used in active persistence mode to perform on-demand snapshots.

For more information on Coherence Persistence, please see the
{commercial-docs-base-url}/administer/persisting-caches.html[Coherence Documentation].

[#what-you-will-build]
=== What You Will Build


You will review the requirements for running both `on-demand` and `active` persistence and carry out the following:

1. Start one or more cache servers with `on-demand` persistence
2. Start a `CohQL` session to insert data and create and manage snapshots
3. Start a JMX MBean listener to monitor Persistence operations
4. Change `on-demand` to `active` persistence and show this in action
5. Work with archiving snapshots

[#review-the-initial-project]
=== Review the Project

[#maven]
==== Maven Configuration

The project is a Coherence project and imports the `coherence-bom` and `coherence-dependencies`
POMs as shown below:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::pom.xml[tag=deps1]
----

The `coherence` library is also included:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::pom.xml[tag=deps2]
----

We also define a number of profiles to run the `DefaultCacheServer` for each cluster and `CohQL` for each cluster.

* <<cache-server,cache-server - Runs a DefaultCacheServer>>
* <<cohql,cohql - Runs a CohQL session>>
* <<notifications,notifications - Runs a process to subscribe to JMX Notification events>>


[#cache-server]
*cache-server* - Runs a `DefaultCacheServer`

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::pom.xml[tag=cache-server]
----
<1> Set on-demand mode, which is the default
<2> Set the base directory for all persistence directories

[#cohql]
*cohql* - Runs a `CohQL` session

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::pom.xml[tag=cohql]
----

[#notifications]
*notifications* - Runs a process to subscribe to JMX Notification events

[source,xml,indent=0]
----

----

[#cache-config]
==== Persistence Configuration

By default, any partitioned service, including Federated services, will default to `on-demand` mode. This mode allows you
to create and manage snapshots to default directories without any setup. A `coherence` directory off the users home
directory is used to store all persistence-related data.

If you wish to enable `active` persistence mode you can use a system property `-Dcoherence.distributed.persistence.mode=active`
and this will use the default directories as described above.

In this example we are also defining the base persistence directory using a system property `-Dcoherence.distributed.persistence.base.dir=persistence-data`.
All other persistence directories will be created below this directory.

Please see {commercial-docs-base-url}/administer/persisting-caches.html#GUID-AA98D601-5CE9-4E33-BB16-487B417BA5A8[here] for more
details on configuring your persistence locations.

In this tutorial, Persistence is configured in two files:

* An operational override file is used to configure non-default persistence environments and archive locations
* A cache configuration with file the `<persistence>` element is used to associate services with persistence environments, if you are not using the defaults. (This is initially commented out.)

**Cache Configuration File**

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/resources/persistence-cache-config.xml[tag=mapping]
----
NOTE: The above cache configuration has the `<persistence>` element commented out for the first part of this tutorial.

**Operational Override File**

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/resources/tangosol-coherence-override.xml[tag=mapping]
----
<1> Defines a snapshot archiver to archive to a given directory

[#listener]
==== Listening to JMX Notifications

Persistence operations generate JMX notifications. You can register for these notifications to monitor and
understand how long these operations are taking.

NOTE: You can use a tool such as VisualVM with the Coherence VisualVM plugin to monitor and manage persistence.
See the VisualVM Plugin project on https://github.com/oracle/coherence-visualvm[GitHub].

----

NOTE: You will be able to see the snapshots in the directory `persistence-data/snapshots`.

[#active-persistence]
=== Enable Active Persistence

==== Run the following commands to exercise `active` Persistence

After shutting down all running processes, in the file `pom.xml` change
`on-demand` to `active` for the `cohql` and `cache-server` profiles to enable active persistence.

Run the `cache-server`, `cohql` and `notifications` as described above.

1. In the `CohQL` session, run the following commands to add data
+
[source,bash]
----
CohQL> select count() from test
Results
0

CohQL>
CohQL> insert into test key(1) value("one")

CohQL> insert into test key(2) value("two")

CohQL> insert into test key(3) value("three")

select count() from test
Results
3
----

2. Shutdown all three processes and restart the `cache-server` and `cohql` processes, then continue below.

3. Re-query the `test` cache
+
[source,bash]
----
CohQL> select * from test
Results
"two"
"three"
"one"
----
+
NOTE: You can see that the cache data has automatically been recovered from disk during cluster startup.
This active persistence data is stored in the directory `persistence-data/active` below the persistence tutorial directory.

[#archiver]
=== Enable a Snapshot Archiver

Snapshots can be archived to a central location and then later retrieved and restored. Archiving snapshots requires defining the directory where
archives are stored and configuring cache services to use an archive directory.

To enable a snapshot archiver in this example, you need to uncomment the `<persistence>` element in the
cache config file `src/main/resources/persistence-cache-config.xml`, and rebuild the project using
Maven or Gradle.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/resources/persistence-cache-config.xml[tag=mapping]
----

1. Archive the existing `data` snapshot.
+
[source,bash]
----
CohQL> archive snapshot "data" "PartitionedCache"
Are you sure you want to archive a snapshot called 'data' for service 'PartitionedCache'? (y/n): y
Archiving snapshot 'data' for service 'PartitionedCache'
Results
"Success"
----

2. Inspect the archive directory contents to determine the cluster name
+
[source,bash,indent=0]
----
$ cd persistence-data/archives/
$ ls
timmiddleton-s-cluster
----
+
NOTE: In the above the cluster name is `timmiddleton's cluster` but a sanitized directory of `timmiddleton-s-cluster` has been used.

3. View the contents of the archived snapshot directory, substituting your cluster directory.
+
[source,bash,indent=0]
----
$ cd timmiddleton-s-cluster/PartitionedCache/data/
$ ls

----
+
NOTE: The directory shows 31 different data files and a `meta.properties` file that contains some metadata.
These files are binary files and can only be used by recovering an archived snapshot.

4. Validate the archived snapshot
+
The following command will ensure that the archived snapshot can be retrieved and is valid. You
should always use this command to ensure the integrity of your archived snapshots.
